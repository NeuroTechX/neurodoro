# Privacy Policy of Neurodoro

## Permissions
EEG 101 asks for the following permissions:
- Internet
- Bluetooth
- Bluetooth_admin
- Access Coarse Location
- Write External Storage


These permissions are required in order to the operate bluetooth and connect to the Muse headband. We do not track user data, nor do we mess with our user's phones.

## Collecting Data
If you follow through the test in the Collect Data screens, data collected from your Muse, along with performance scores from the test, will be uploaded to our database. There is a unique key created initially upon installation of the app that we use to differentiate data between users. However, we do not collect or attempt to analyze data for further identifying information. We are hoping to introduce encryption and personal ownership to EEG data in the future and appreciate your patience as we get there.
