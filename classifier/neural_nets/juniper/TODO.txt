TODO

 - compare riemannian embedded data against
    - random
    - raw
    - filtered
 - faster CPU instructions
 - add precision and recall metrics
 - train / validate / test control flow
     - validate while training
     - run training op on validation set every X epochs?
 - batch norm?
 - try a second order optimizer
 - Adaptive learning rate
 - be able to create model checkpoints
 - quantizing the model, make sit smaller for mobile
 - make tensorboard useful?
